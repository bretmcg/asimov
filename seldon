The first time lightning struck I started a college DVD project. The second time was the royal flush. The third time was this winter,
third time's the charm.

This is the end of Plan 1 that I started putting into motion on January 8th, 2026.
Here's what I hope we got:

Universal healthcare (please please, c'mon man)
bretflix.com
crypto only uses $ as a supercoin, it's the real money now
people are more joyful!
raccoons have been domesticated
livin' good and livin' somewhere good
we've chilled out on guns

man I'm out of ideas... then what about a constitution.md?
LET'S WRITE A BIG ASS AMENDMENT

for the people
